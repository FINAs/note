# Proxy


http vs socks

1.http

when you use a HTTP proxy you are actually forwarding the HTTP request, and the HTTP proxy server then performs the request on your behalf. 

1.socks

 When a connection is established, the client communicates with the SOCKS server using the SOCKS protocol. The external server communicates with the SOCKS server as if it were the actual client.
